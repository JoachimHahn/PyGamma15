# Workshop email 2

Dear colleagues,

thanks for participating in the PyGamma15 workshop!

The workshop webpage is here:
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/

About 30 participants have signed up:
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#participants

We will start next Monday, November 16th at 9.15 am.
If you take bus number 39 from Bismarckplatz at 8.43 am you will be at MPIK in time.

Below find some more information.
Please let us know if there is some information missing of if you have any questions!

Best regards,

## Program

The schedule / program has changed a bit over the last weeks, please have another look:
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#schedule-overview

We had a few requests for talks / tutorials on gamma-ray specific codes,
and accepted those in favor of more general Python programming talks / tutorials.

The tutorials now take up a large fraction of the time on Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday.
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#schedule-tutorials

We considered scheduling tutorials in parallel to have more "unconference sessions"
for free discussion and coding, but in the end decided against it to give
everyone the chance to participate in all the tutorials they are interested in.

Note that we don't expect everyone to go to all the tutorials, instead feel
free to just attend the ones you like, and otherwise spend time talking or
coding in small groups (coding works best in groups of two or three).

## Twitter and remote participation

We want to keep it simple, so remote participation is not possible and
we didn't set up a mailing list for the workshop.

It's not clear to us if this will be used / useful, but if you're on Twitter
discussing workshop-related topics, please use hashtag `#PyGamma15`.

## Prepare

If you're new to Python, please spend some time going through some tutorials this week.
See http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#prepare for pointers,
especially http://www.scipy-lectures.org/ and http://python4astronomers.github.io/
are quite good and are useful for self-study.

It's also very useful if you learn a bit about how to use Git and how Github
works before the workshop. That's what most open-source project represented at
this workshop (and in general) use to collaborate. If you have that part figured
out (how to communicate via Github issues, clone a repo, make a branch and  pull
request) you can concentrate on the Python coding in the tutorials and making a
first contribution to one of the packages represented at the workshop (or
open-source an existing code of yours or start a new package).

## Talk presenters

If you are scheduled to give a presentation, please have a look at
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#schedule-monday
and see how much time you have and how your presentation fits in the agenda.

Note that the "methods" section is now scheduled in the morning, before
the "instruments" session ... we felt this order would be a bit better.

Presenters can use their own laptop (please try if it works before the session),
or give a PDF and use a presenter laptop.

If you're willing to put a PDF version of your slides online, that would be great!
The workshop materials (talks, tutorials, minutes) will be a useful resource 
for people that couldn't attend the workshop, and for ourselves.
Please make a pull request to your talk folder at
https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks
before or after your presentation.

## Tutorial presenters

If you're presenting a tutorial, please go to
http://gammapy.github.io/PyGamma15/#schedule-tutorials
and check if the description of your tutorial is OK.

One of the most important things to describe is to tell participants how
to prepare, i.e. which software (and version if relevant) they should install
(and example data download if needed).
You don't want to spend a lot of time during the tutorial to get everyone
set up, ideally all participants would come prepared.

As an example for what information to give, see
https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/tutorials/analysis-stats#how-to-prepare
(you don't have to give an IPython notebook, just some text description of a 
Python script to check the installation are also good).

If you can make your code / tutorial examples run on Python 3, please do!

Participants - please note that none of the tutorials that will be given
at the workshop is available online yet. Please have some patience!

Presenters - Please try to finish your tutorials and description in
the README before the workshop starts!
