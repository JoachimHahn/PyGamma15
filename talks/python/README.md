# Talk - Why Python for gamma-ray astronomy?

* Presenter: [Karl Kosack](https://github.com/kosack/)
* Duration: 12 + 3 min

## Abstract

Explain why Python makes sense for gamma-ray astronomy.
Give an high-level overview of the language (Py 2 / 3),
Scipy packages (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Numba) and tools (IPython, pytest, ...)

## Outline

* Language
* Packages
* Tools

## References

* See tutorials on Tuesday

* Rethinking the Gammapy stack: thoughts on how to collaborate more with other packages (Astropy, Astropy affiliated packages, Sherpa, Naima, ctapipe, Gammalib, ctools, 3ML, FermiPy, ...) to avoid duplication of effort and enable multi-mission analyses and astrophysical modeling.
