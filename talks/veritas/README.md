# Talk - VERITAS data analysis with open source tools

* Presenter: [Nathan Kelley-Hoskins](https://github.com/nkelhos)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

CTOOLS is a software package for analyzing x-ray and gamma-ray data.
VERITAS is a terrestrial gamma-ray observatory, sensitive to gamma rays from 85 GeV to 30 TeV.
As CTOOLS is built around likelihood modelling, it can be used to analyse regions of the sky that have complex morphology, including multiple spatially- and spectrally-distinct sources.
This presentation will discuss different tools within CTOOLS, current progress on converting VERITAS data/irfs to CTOOLS format, and ongoing VERITAS research projects utilizing CTOOLS.
