* Presenter: Lea Jouvin
* Duration: 10 + 5 min

## Abstract

tbd

## Outline

TODO: Summarize what is covered in bullet points
(this is to help us assemble the program for the workshop)

* ...
* What is bias? 
* If possible: Super-simple analytic example why it can occur in likelihood estimators
* When does it occur in spectral estimators? How large is it?
* Observation grouping as one option to fix the bias -> why does it help?
* ...
* Status and plans: suggestions what to work on this week
