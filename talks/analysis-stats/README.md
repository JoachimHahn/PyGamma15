# Talk - Detection and parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy

* Presenter: looking for a speaker
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

Frequentist and Bayesian methods for parameter estimation and detection

## Outline

TODO: Summarize what is covered in bullet points
(this is to help us assemble the program for the workshop)

* ...
* Profile likelihood
* Coverage
* Explain TS and Wilk's theorem, Li & Ma
* Explain how sensitivity and upper limits and parameter errors relate
* Frequentist and Bayesian likelihood analysis; optimisation vs. sampling; parameter estimation and detection
* Maybe something like this (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1411.5018V)
  and follow up with a tutorial later in the week?
* How to handle systematic errors in gamma-ray astronomy should probably a separate presentation,
  but do we have time / a speaker?
* ...
* Status and plans of tools: suggestions what to work on this week
