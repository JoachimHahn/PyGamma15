# Talk - Fermi-LAT basics

* Presenter: [Jeremy Perkins](https://github.com/kialio/)
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

This talk will give an introduction to [Fermi](http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/)-LAT data analysis
with a focus on technical details about the files and data model, i.e. information
that's not necessarily needed for end-users, but is important to know for advanced users
or developers that want to know how it works "under the hood".

The [Fermi-LAT advanced](https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks/fermi-advanced)
presentation will focus on Pass 8 and event classes, and the
[Fermi-LAT data analysis tutorial](https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/tutorials/fermi)
later in the week will give a hands-on introduction.

## Outline

* Content and format of the various files (event list, IRFs, ScienceTools outputs)
* Science tools analysis chain and how e.g. data selection cuts is communicated between tools
* ScienceTools Python interface
