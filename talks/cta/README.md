# Talk - CTA data

* Presenter: Catherine Boisson
* Duration: 15 + 5 min

## Abstract

The [Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)](www.cta-observatory.org) is the
next-generation observatory for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy.

This presentation will give an overview of the activities in the CTA DATA
working group.

The current status and work in progress concerning the specification of data
model at level 3 (which is the output of the CTA pipeline and the input to the
science tools: event lists, instrument response functions, ...) will be
explained.

## Outline

TODO: Summarize what is covered in bullet points
(this is to help us assemble the program for the workshop)

* ...
* CTA event list and IRF format specification status / timeline
* DL3 and higher data formats
* Describe how data will be distributed?
* ...
* What can we work on this week?
