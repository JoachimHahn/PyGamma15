# Talk - Sherpa

* Presenter: tbd
* Duration: 12 + 3 min

## Abstract

[Sherpa](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/) is CIAO's modeling and fitting package.
It enables the user to construct complex models from simple definitions and fit
those models to data, using a variety of statistics and optimization methods.

On April 20, 2015, Sherpa became an open source project on Github
([blogpost](http://pysherpa.blogspot.de/2015/04/sherpa-becomes-open-project.html)).
It can now be easily installed as a standalone Python package, without requiring CIAO.

This talk will give an overview of the Sherpa package itself.

How to use it for gamma-ray data analysis specifically will be discussed
in the presentations and tutorials on Gammapy and Naima.

## Outline

* ... TODO: describe what will be covered.
* Outlook: 4.8 release
* Suggestions how to get started contributing to Sherpa at this workshop.
* TBD: We might add a tutorial specifically for Sherpa.

  They mostly use Chandra X-ray data, but are still very useful for gamma-ray astronomers,
  because gamma-ray data analysis is similar.
