# Talk - Open-source Python project development on Github

* Presenter: looking for a speaker ... you?
* Duration: 12 + 3 min

## Abstract

This presentation will give an overview of how most open-source Python projects
are run these days, explaining the tools (git, pytest, Sphinx) and
free web services (Github, travis-ci, Read the docs) and
workflows involved.


## Outline

- Open source, reproducible and open science
- The [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system
- Development workflow with [Github](https://github.com/)
- Issues, pull requests, code review
- Testing with [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) and [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/)
- Documentation with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) and [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
- TBD: cover releases and distribution via PyPI and anaconda.org as well?
- TBD: Thoughts / experiences on using these services for large astronomy projects (Astropy, LSST, Sherpa, CTA, ...) versus setting up equivalent services on collaboration servers to be independent.
