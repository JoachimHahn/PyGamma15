# Talk - Gammapy

* Presenter: Christoph Deil
* Duration: 12 + 3 min

## Abstract

[Gammapy](https://gammapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
 is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.
 
 It is an in-development affiliated package of Astropy that builds on the core
 scientific Python stack to provide tools to simulate and analyse the gamma-ray
 sky for telescopes such as CTA, H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, HAWC and Fermi-LAT.

 Please see the [About Gammapy](https://gammapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about.html#about-gammapy)
 page and the [ICRC 2015 proceeding](https://indico.cern.ch/event/344485/session/142/contribution/695/attachments/1136524/1626431/gammapy-icrc2015.pdf) for further information.
 
 In this presentation, I will give an overview of Gammapy and discuss the status
  (the recent Gammapy 0.5 release) and plans for the project.
 
## Outline

* What is Gammapy?
* The Gammapy stack (see previous presentations on Scientific Python stack, Astropy and Gammapy)
* Gammapy development on Github
* Current status: overview of sub-packages and features
* Next steps: towards the 1.0 release and a paper and beyond
* Rethinking the Gammapy stack: thoughts on how to collaborate more with other packages (Astropy, Astropy affiliated packages, Sherpa, Naima, ctapipe, Gammalib, ctools, 3ML, FermiPy, ...) to avoid duplication of effort and enable multi-mission analyses and astrophysical modeling.
* What can we achieve this week?
