# Talk - Astropy, Sherpa, Gammapy

* Presenter: [Axel Donath](https://github.com/adonath/)
* Duration: 20 + 5 min

## Abstract

The [Astropy project](http://www.astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop
a single core package for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability
between Python astronomy packages.

[Sherpa](http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/) is a Python modeling and fitting package.
It enables the user to construct complex models from simple definitions and fit
those models to data, using a variety of statistics and optimization methods.

[Gammapy](https://gammapy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is a
community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy. It is
an in-development affiliated package of Astropy that builds on the core
scientific Python stack as well as Astropy and Sherpa to provide tools to
simulate and analyse the gamma-ray sky for telescopes such as CTA, H.E.S.S.,
VERITAS, MAGIC, HAWC and Fermi-LAT.

This presentation will give an overview of Astropy, Sherpa and Gammapy and
discuss the status (the recent Gammapy 0.5 release) and plans for Gammapy.
A hands-on tutorial "Getting started with Gammapy" will be given later in the week.

## Outline

* Overview Astropy core packages (fits, table, wcs, time, coordinates, modeling).
* Overview of some relevant Astropy affiliated packages
* Overview Sherpa
* Gammapy overview, status, scope
* Gammapy next steps and goals:
  * improve Gammapy quality (code, tests, docs), Sherpa and Naima integration
  * cube and multi-mission analysis (e.g. Fermi-LAT and IACT)
  * 1.0 release, a paper
* What can we work on  / achieve this week?
