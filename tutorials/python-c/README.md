# Tutorial - Python C extensions

* Presenter: we're looking for a presenter ... please volunteer!
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: tbd
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This is a beginner-level tutorial on Python C extensions, i.e. how to
interface C code with Python.

We will show how to create a Python wrapper for a function from a C library
using the most popular methods.

To be decided:
- Cover [numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) as well?
- Cover how to wrap a C++ classes with SWIG as well?
- Cover speed / profiling here?

## How to prepare

## Agenda

TODO: this is just a first suggestion, to be fleshed out:

* Follow https://scipy-lectures.github.io/advanced/interfacing_with_c/interfacing_with_c.html ?

- [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)?
- [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)?
- [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/)
- [Cython](http://cython.org/)
- Show C extension code in Astropy, Gammapy, ctapipe, Sherpa and explain
  how the build works?
- Summary, comparison of methods.

## Going further

TODO: give some suggestions / links what participants can do
after the tutorial to learn more ...
