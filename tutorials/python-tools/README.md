# Tutorial - Python developer tools

* Presenter: [Christoph Deil](https://github.com/cdeil)
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: Tuesday, 16:00 - 17:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This tutorial will briefly introduce you to a bunch of tools that can
help you as a Python developer to be more productive.
We will spend ~ 10 minutes per tool, always with a ~ 5 min intro / demo,
followed by you using the tool for a few minutes.

The goal is to make you aware of some of the existing tools and get you
started. Using the links provided here you can then follow up later at 
your own pace and really get to know the tools you think might be useful
to you.

We plan to cover the following tools (deviations from this plan are possible
though):

* [IPython](http://ipython.org/) - Interactive computing in the terminal
* [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Interactive computing in the web browser
* [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) – Testing Python packages
* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) – Documenting Python packages
* [coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Measure code coverage
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - The most intelligent Python IDE
* [pep8](http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Python [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide checker
* [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8#autopep8) - Python PEP8 auto code formatter
* [prospector](http://prospector.readthedocs.org/en/master/) - Python static analysis

Maybe these should be covered as well here or in some other tutorial?

* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/),
  [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/),
  [setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/) - [Python packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/current.html)
* [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) - Multi-platform package and environment management system
* [debugging](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/advanced/debugging/)?

TODO: should we cover IPython here or in the `python-scientific` tutorial?

Timing / profiling tools for Python performance analysis:

* https://scipy-lectures.github.io/advanced/optimizing/index.html

## How to prepare

If you want to follow along during the tutorial and do the excercises,
you should install the tools listed above before and check that they work.

As an example, to install pytest, use `pip install pytest`
or `conda install pytest` and then run `py.test --help` to make sure
it's working (if you see some help message, you're all set).

## Agenda

TODO: describe what we'll do and make same small exercises

## Going further

TODO: give some suggestions / links what participants can do
after the tutorial to learn more ...
