# Tutorial - Python developer tools

* Presenter: [Christoph Deil](https://github.com/cdeil)
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: Tuesday, 11:00 - 12:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This tutorial will briefly introduce you to a bunch of tools that can
help you as a Python developer to be more productive.
We will spend on average ~ 10 minutes per tool, with a ~ 5 min intro / demo,
followed by you using the tool for a few minutes.

The goal is to make you aware of some of the existing tools and get you
started. Using the links provided here you can then follow up later at 
your own pace and really get to know the tools you think might be useful
to you.

We plan to cover the following tools (deviations from this plan are possible
though):

* [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/) – Testing Python packages
* [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) – Documenting Python packages
* [coverage.py](http://coverage.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Measure code coverage
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - The most intelligent Python IDE
* [python-modernize](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-modernize) and [six](http://pythonhosted.org/six/) - Python 2 / 3 compatible code
* [pep8](http://pep8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - Python [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide checker
* [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8#autopep8) - Python PEP8 auto code formatter
* [prospector](http://prospector.readthedocs.org/en/master/) - Python static analysis
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/),
  [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/),
  [setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/) - [Python packaging](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/current.html)
* [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) - Multi-platform package and environment management system
* (Probably no time, maybe very briefly: [debugging](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/advanced/debugging/))

## How to prepare

If you want to follow along during the tutorial and do the exercises,
you should install the tools listed above before and check that they work.

As an example, to install pytest, use `pip install pytest`
or `conda install pytest` and then run `py.test --help` to make sure
it's working (if you see some help message, you're all set).
