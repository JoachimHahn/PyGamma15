# Tutorial - Python programming

* Presenter: [Axel Donath](https://github.com/adonath)
* Duration: 75 min
* Time: Tuesday, 9:15 - 10:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This is a beginner to mid-level Python programming tutorial.

We start from scratch and briefly review the basics, but we assume that
you have written some Python scripts containing functions and classes.

The idea is to teach you the parts of the language that you need to
understand how packages like e.g. Astropy work.
Advanced Python language constructs like how to write your own decorator
or C extension will **not** be covered.

TODO: do we agree on this approach? Or what should be covered?

## How to prepare

## Agenda

TODO: this is just a first suggestion, to be fleshed out:

- functions in depth (arguments, return, scope)
- classes / instances in depth
- class inheritance and super
- staticmethod, classmethod
- Python 2 / 3 compatible code with future imports and six
- Python import system (relative, absolute, circular import example)
- Exceptions

## Going further

TODO: give some suggestions / links what participants can do
after the tutorial to learn more ...
