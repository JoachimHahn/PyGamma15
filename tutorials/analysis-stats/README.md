* Presenter: Michael Schmelling
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: Tuesday, 16:00 - 17:30
* Location: Central seminar room

## Abstract

This tutorial will cover the material presented at the [statistics
talk](https://github.com/gammapy/2015-MPIK-Workshop/tree/gh-pages/talks/analysis-stats)
on Monday, going over the theoretical concepts and computational methods again
in more detail, and a series of examples and exercises.

TODO: decide if [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) via the [pyroot](https://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/guides/users-guide/ROOTUsersGuide.html#pyroot-overview)
interface should be used, or other Python packages like [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/)
and [iminuit](http://iminuit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

TODO: Use some real gamma-ray data (e.g. from HESS or Fermi) of just simulate
some data using toy models?
