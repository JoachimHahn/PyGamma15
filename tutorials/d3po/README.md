## Abstract

In this tutorial I will briefly introduce D3PO, which addresses the inference
problem of denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing photon observations. Its
primary goal is thereby to simultaneously but individual reconstruct the diffuse
and point like photon flux given a photon count image.

D3PO is based on information field theory (IFT), which will be introduced as
well. IFT is a  Bayesian framework for signal processing and image
reconstruction. For practical calculations 'Numerical information field theory'-
NIFTy can be used. NIFTy is a versatile Python library to enable the development
of signal inference algorithms that operate regardless of the underlying spatial
grid and its resolution. 

Within a first practical hands on session we will guide the audience thru some
examples (Wiener filter etc.) and thereby demonstrate NIFTy principle
capabilities. Then the usage of D3PO will be demonstrated.
