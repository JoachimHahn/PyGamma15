## Abstract

This tutorial teaches you how to contribute code (with tests and docs)
to open-source Python projects on [Github](https://github.com/)
using [git](https://git-scm.com/).

Every project is a little different concerning package layout, 
and how to run tests and build the docs.
For this tutorial, we'll follow the
[Astropy contributing guidelines](http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#contributing)
and use a test repository that follows the
[Astropy package template](https://github.com/astropy/package-template).

The goal is that every participants understands the workflow and
has gone through it once to make a contribution to a test repository.
