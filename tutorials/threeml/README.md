# Tutorial - How to analyze multi-mission data using 3ML

* Presenter: [Luigi Tibaldo](https://github.com/tibaldo)
* Duration: 90 min
* Time: tbd
* Location: tbd

## Abstract

This is a tutorial on how to get started with 3ML as a user to perform
joint analysis of data from multiple instruments.
The concept of 3ML will be covered in the
[previous talk](https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks/threeml/README.md)
on Monday.

You will go through a joint spectral analysis of Fermi-LAT and tbd
observations of a point source using 3ML. The tutorial will make use of
an ipython notebook on a remote server. 

## How to prepare

If you did not attend the Monday session please take a look at the
slides [here](https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks/threeml/README.md) 

## Agenda

TBD

## Going further

After the tutorial you can install 3ML on your computer to run
your own analyses. Note
that running an analysis using 3ML requires as well to install the
software underlying the plugins for each instrument (e.g., the
Fermi-LAT Science Tools if you want to analyze Fermi-LAT data, etc.). 

Note also that 3ML is a very young project and there are many areas
where the features, implementation and documentation is work in progress.
So please have some patience and let us know where we should put our
priorities. We can also discuss possible contributions if you want to
become a co-developer.
