Please make a pull request to add a description and materials
for your tutorial here (one sub-folder per presentation).

It would help us a lot if you could add a `README.md` file outlining
the content of your presentation here, so that we can make sure
all relevant info is covered and the order of presentations makes sense.

Each tutorial will be ~ 60 or 90 minutes.
If you need more time, the tutorial should be split in two parts.
