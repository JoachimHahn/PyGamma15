# Tutorials

## Intro

Some tutorials will be mostly demos and you can participate by just
watching the presenter explain code and run commands.

Other tutorials will be more hands-on, where participants are supposed
to execute examples themselves or even with coding exercises.

In those cases you'll want a laptop with Python and the required packages
installed. Every tutorial contains a "how to prepare" section with instructions
what software to install **before the tutorial**.

## Anaconda

We recommend you go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and get Anaconda.
Miniconda is fine as well if you're on a slow network or low on disk space
... see [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/faq.html#general-questions) for
an explanation what `conda`, `Anaconda` and `miniconda` are.

It doesn't matter much if you get the Python 2.7 or the Python 3.5 installer
for Anaconda or miniconda. With either version you'll be able to install
Python and packages simultaneously with any of the Python versions 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
If you're confused, just download the Python 3.5 installer.

TODO: give commands how to install common software for Python 2.7 and 3.4
(quite a few packages don't work with Python 3.5 yet, so best to stick with Python 3.4 for now)

TODO: set alias to that Python 2 / 3 environment?

```
