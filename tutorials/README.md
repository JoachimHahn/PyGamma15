## General info for presenters

Please make a pull request to add a description and materials
for your tutorial here (one sub-folder per presentation).

It would help us a lot if you could add a `README.md` file outlining
the content of your presentation here, so that we can make sure
all relevant info is covered and the order of presentations makes sense.

Each tutorial will be 75 or 90 minutes.
If you need more time, the tutorial should be split in two parts.

Please add a `tutorial-setup-check.py` script in your tutorial folder,
that checks if the software and data needed is available.
Providing a script or Makefile that downloads the required data is
also simpler for participants than instructions they have to follow manually.

If possible, please structure the tutorial so that everything happens
in your tutorial folder of this git repo.
This makes instructions simpler and work exactly the same for everyone.
